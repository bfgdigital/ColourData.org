# colourdata
A self-calibrating CV testing environment.
This anonymous data collection project is based on the Ishihara colour perception test invented by Shinobu Ishihara, a professor at the University of Tokyo, who first published his tests in 1917.

This basic image generator is collecting data about semi-randomly generated colour information which is slowly mapping out the range of different colour strengths and weaknesses present in the population. Over time the tool will continue to be improved.

It's "Self Calibrating" because the tests get more difficult over time as more users add data. The colour data and responses are fed into machine learning algorithms which find patterns and adjust the pallets to better test certain ranges of colour based recognition.

Please ensure only one person is answering the questions per device at a time and try to answer questions as fast as possible, (100+ would be ideal) so that useful and reliable statistics can be processed and results displayed soon.

Thanks so much for your time and help. ~ Ben
